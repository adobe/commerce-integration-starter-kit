# Integrate Adobe Commerce customer-created event with a third party.
This runtime action is responsible for notifying the integration with the 3rd party after a customer is created in Adobe Commerce.

# Incoming event payload
The incoming event payload depends on the fields specified during the event registration in Adobe Commerce. For more information, please check it here: https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/events/configure-commerce/#subscribe-and-register-events.
Here is a payload example of the data received in the event:
```json
{
   "id": 1,
   "created_at":"2000-12-31 16:52:40",
   "updated_at":"2000-12-31 16:48:40"
}
```
There is other interesting information that you can access from `params`, like the event type and event ID.

## Connect with the 3rd party
The `sendData` function in the `sender.js` file defines the connection with the third party. 
Please include all the authentication and connection login on that `sender.js` file or an extracted file outside `index.js`. 
Any values from the environment could be accessed from `params`. Pass the required parameters by the action by configuring them in the `actions/customer/commerce/actions.config.yaml` under `created -> inputs` as follows:
```yaml
created:
  function: commerce/created/index.js
  web: 'no'
  runtime: nodejs:20
  inputs:
    LOG_LEVEL: debug
    HERE_YOUR_PARAM: $HERE_YOUR_PARAM_ENV
  annotations:
    require-adobe-auth: true
    final: true
```
