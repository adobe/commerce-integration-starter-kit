# Integrate a third party order status updated event with Adobe Commerce.
This runtime action is responsible for notifying the integration with Adobe Commerce after an order status is updated in the 3rd party.
As a result of processing this event a comment will be added to the related order.

# Incoming event payload
The incoming event payload depends on the third party API and entity model.
Here is a payload example of the data received in the event:
```json
{
  "id": 99,
  "status": "shipped",
  "notifyCustomer": false
}
```

# Data validation
The incoming data is validated against a JSON schema defined in the `schema.json` file.
Here's an example:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "integer" },
    "status": { "type": "string" },
    "notifyCustomer": { "type":  "boolean"}
  },
  "required": ["id", "status"],
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

## Interact with the Adobe Commerce API
The `sendData` function in the `sender.js` file defines the interaction with the Adobe Commerce API.
This function delegates to the `addComment` method in the `actions/order/commerce-order-api-client.js` the interaction with the Commerce API.
Any parameters needed from the execution environment could be accessed from `params`.
These parameters can be passed on the action by configuring them in the  `actions/order/external/actions.config.yaml` under `updated -> inputs` as follows:
```yaml
updated:
  function: updated/index.js
  web: 'no'
  runtime: nodejs:20
  inputs:
    LOG_LEVEL: debug
    COMMERCE_BASE_URL: $COMMERCE_BASE_URL
    COMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY: $COMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY
    COMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET: $COMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET
    COMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN: $COMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN
    COMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: $COMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
  annotations:
    require-adobe-auth: true
    final: true
```
